        <h3>Wireframing</h3>
        <p>I began developing the initial wireframes, focusing on interactions that will allow users to quickly review an episode of their favorite show as soon as they finish it. Along with quickly posting reviews, the user is able to see their friend's reviews of the same episode.</p>
