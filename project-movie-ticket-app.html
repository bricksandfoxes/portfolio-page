                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>The movie ticketing app is a UX portfolio project I embarked on after a project generator suggested making a movie ticketing app, where users can easily search for a movie showing close to them and buy a ticket. Seemed simple at first until I started researching existing apps and user pain points. Many users expressed frustration with clunky interfaces, poor filtering options, and lack of visual confirmations. My goal with this project was to create a seamless and enjoyable ticket purchasing experience that addresses these issues.

                <h3>Conceptualization</h3>
                <p>I kicked off this project by conducting extensive user research and competitive analysis online. I went to social media sites where moviegoers frequent such as Reddit (and related subreddits), Twitter, Bluesky, and various online forms I came across during my research. I found that users were consistenly frustrated with four distinct things:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Seat mapping:</strong> Moviegoers had a hard time navigating through traditional seat maps, struggling to find the “best” available seats during peak hours or assigning group seats. Sometimes users would even resort to keeping spreadsheets of their favorite seats before booking a ticket.
                    </li>
                    <div class="quote-box">
                        <q>I can usually tell the general layout just by looking at it but the seat maps can be deceiving sometimes</q> 
                        <div class="link">
                            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AMCsAList/comments/1k01kda/comment/mnastj2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button" target="_blank">

                            </a>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Search Filtering:</strong> Users had to navigate through movies before seeing what is available near them, when some moviegoers preferred wanting to see what is near them or at certain theaters.
                    </li> 
                    <li>
                       <strong>Relevant Options</strong> Casual moviegoers were wanting options that allowed them to see movies that are personalized to their interest instead of sorting through latest blockbusters.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Poor Confirmation</strong> Users were confused on whether or not they had even purchased tickets, with a lack of proper confirmation elements.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Wireframing</h3>
                <p>Though it is embarassing to admit, the bulk of my focus on this project was the seating process. There were a lot more opportunities improving the steat selection process than the other aspects of the app, given users mainly complained about the seating process.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I laid out a couple of ideas before landing on this process:</p>
                <br>
                <div class="hero-image">
                    <img src="content/construction.png" alt="Movie Ticketing App Hero" class="hero-pic">
                </div>
                <br>
                <p>Throughout my research, I noticed many users giving recommendations for their favorite seats and auditoriums at their local theaters. This gave me the idea to go the crowdsourcing route and provide recommended seats based on user input.</p>
